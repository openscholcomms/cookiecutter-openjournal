# Open Journal Template: Frictionless Journal Setup

_Budget or technical expertise should not limit the spread of knowledge_

If you identify with this problem statement, this project is for you:

> As someone who wants to create an open journal with minimal 
> technical overhead, I would like to have a publishing platform that 
> is free, easy to setup, and easy to use, so I can help researchers 
> publish their work as smoothly and quickly as possible.

This project provides template for you to create such a journal in no 
time. It uses GitHub to give you the key features you need, but hides
technical details and irrelevant features that add 
friction to the publishing process. To create a new journal:

 1. Create an [account on Github][gh-account] and login.

 2. Click on the `Use this template` green button above and select the 
    Github organization or user where the journal will live.

 3. Remove these instructions from the `README.md` file and replace 
    them for the description of your journal. We show an example below 
    where we use `<OJ>` as the name of your domain of study.
